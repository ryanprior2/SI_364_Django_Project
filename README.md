My idea is a video game rating application. It forces users to log in and make an account. Users have a database of friends (other users) as well as a database where they can input a video game title and a rating for it. The app will rank users video games in order (1 - however many they have rated), as well as have the rating given by the user (1 - 10) attached to the game title. Users will be able to see friend's games that they play and get a good view of how they ranked them overall and how they stack up on their friends personal chart. It is like each person is building a resume of what games they play across all platforms and attaching a score. This will make it easier to see if friends have played the same games as you and also allow you to see if they are into the same games or find them boring. I can also add other databases that collect data from users that could eventually calculate average score for games or the games overall popularity.
